    > This is graphzen &mdash; a decentralized web of checklists.

    ### What is Graphzen?

    Graphzen is a proposal to create a standard file exchange format for checklists. Upon adoption, it aims to achieve an interlinked web of procedural checklists that could span to various organizational processes.

    Features includes:
    - Simple and intuitive syntax
    - Hyperlinking between different checklists
    - Customizable and open-source checklist browser

    ### Motivation

    Processing professional documents that requires inter-organizational transactions ( e.g. government forms, medical requirements, institutional clearances, etc. ) is VERY time consuming. 
    A big factor in this inefficiency is the impossibility to know all of their dependencies ahead of time (You'll only be aware of what they require once you're already there üòü). On troublesome occasions, they happen to have circular dependencies ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

    On a related note, checklist apps are springing up like mushrooms!
    Although it offers consumers a lot of choices, integrating all of them can be chaotic. 

    This is where [Graphzen](https://github.com/JustroX/graphzen) comes into play. [Graphzen](https://github.com/JustroX/graphzen) provides a standard interface in exhanging checklist information between different systems so that tasks integration and dependency resolution is better and faster.

    [Graphzen](https://github.com/JustroX/graphzen) is heavily inspired by the World Wide Web. W3 is for documents, while [Graphzen](https://github.com/JustroX/graphzen) is for checklists.

    # Getting Started

    Graphzen's notation is familiar and intuitive.
    Here are some examples
    ...
    
    - Basic List
        ...
        ### Basic List
        A basic checklist should contain
        
        - A title - title is defined to be the entire first line of the file.
        - At least one checklist item - a checklist item is defined by prefixing a line with a `- `
        
        Example:
        ```
        Shopping list
        - Bread
        - Milk
        - Butter
        ```
        ...
    - Nested Items
        ...
        ### Nested Items
        You can nest items by indenting the a line. A line with more indention than its previous line is considered to be a subitem of the previous item.
        
        ```
        Shopping List
        - Fruits
            - Apple
            - Banana
            - Orange
        - Frozen
            - Hotdog
            - Milk
            - Ice cream
        ```
        ...
    - Linked to other checklist
        ...
        ### Linked item to a seperate file.
        You can link an item to a separate Graphzen checklist.
        Just add a pipe `|` character and supply the URL of the checklist to the `ref` attribute.
        
        ```
        Some serious form processing
        - Accomplish form from department A | ref=link_to_department_a.gtxt
        - Accomplish form from department B | ref=link_to_department_b.gtxt
        ```
        ...
    - Item with notes
        ...
        ### Item notes
        You can add a note to an item. A note block starts and ends with a `...`.
        The note belongs to the adjacent item declared above it.
        
        ```
        Shopping List
        - Fruits
            \...
                Fruits are the best.
            \...
        - Frozen
            - Ice cream
                \...
                    Mango graham plss
                \...
        ```

Depending on your Graphzen browser, the notes can be parsed as markdown and/or latex.

        ```
        Markdown example
        - Item 1
            \...
                \# This is a heading
                This note supports \*\*markdown\*\*. 
                Latex equation: \$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \$
            \...
        ```
